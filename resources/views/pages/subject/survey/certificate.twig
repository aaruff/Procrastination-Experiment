                    <p>Suppose that you win 10 certificates, each of which can be used (once) to receive a
                    dream restaurant night. On each such night, you and a companion will get the best table
                    and an unlimited budget for food and drink at a restaurant of your choosing.
                    There will be no cost to you: all payments including gratuities come as part of the prize.
                    The certificates are available for immediate use, starting tonight, and there is an absolute
                    guarantee that they will be honored by any restaurant you select if they are used within a two year window.
                    However if they are not used up within this two year period, any that remain are valueless.
                    The questions below concern how many of the certificates you would ideally like to use in each year,
                    how tempted you would be to depart from this ideal, and what you expect you would do in practice:
